# gem-decklist-checkboxes

This is a small javascript code, that simply adds checkboxes to the deck registration sheet, making it possible to check cards one at a time.

To use this script:
1.        Go to the deck details page.

2.        Click Print -> this will take you to a deck registration sheet.

3.        Open Inspect (Right click + inspect, or see this tutorial for more info: https://zapier.com/blog/inspect-element-tutorial/)

4.        In the inspect tool, go to the Console tab.

5.        Paste the provided script inside the console and press enter.

6.        The checkboxes should appear.

7.        You can now close the inspect tool.



Please note:
* The checkboxes will disappear after the page is refreshed or reloaded!
* Checking/unchecking the checkboxes does not affect the player’s decklist in any way or mark the deck as reviewed in GEM.
* This process must be repeated for each new decklistyou want to check.  

Feel free to share, use or improve the script — may it serve you well!
